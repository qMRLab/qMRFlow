OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

--platform                      ["octave"/"matlab"] Platform choice. 
--qmrlab_dir                    ["/path/to/qMRLab" OR null] Absolute path to the qMRLab's 
                                root directory. If docker is enabled, MUST be set 
                                to null (without double quotes). If docker is NOT enabled,
                                then the absolute path to the qMRLab MUST be provided.
                                Note that qMRLab version MUST be equal or greater than v2.3.1. 
--octave_path                   ["/path/to/octave_exec" OR null] Absolute path to Octave's 
                                executable. If docker is enabled, or, if you'd like to use
                                Octave executable saved to your system path, MUST be set to
                                null (without double quotes).
--matlab_path                   ["/path/to/matlab_exec" OR null] Absolute path to MATLAB's 
                                executable. If you'd like to use MATLAB executable saved to 
                                your system path, MUST be set to null (without double quotes).
                                Note that qMRLab requires MATLAB > R2014b. Docker image 
                                containing MCR compiled version of this application is NOT 
                                available yet. Therefore, container declerations for the
                                processes starting with Fit_ prefix MUST be set to null 
                                (without double quotes).  
--ants_dim                      [2/3/4] This option forces the image to be treated 
                                as a specified-dimensional image. If not specified,
                                ANTs tries to infer the dimensionality.
--ants_metric                   ["MI"] Confined to MI: Mutual information, for this 
                                particular pipeline.
--ants_metric_weight            [0-1] If multimodal (i.e. changing contrast) use weight 1.
                                This parameter is used to modulate the per stagehting
                                of the metrics.
--ants_metric_bins              [e.g. 32] Number of bins.
--ants_metric_sampling          ["Regular","Random:]The point set can be on a regular 
                                lattice or a random lattice of points slightly perturbed
                                to minimize aliasing artifacts.
--ants_metric_samplingprct      [0-100] The fraction of points to select from the domain
--ants_transform                "Rigid"
                                "Affine"
                                "CompositeAffine"
                                "Similarity"
                                "Translation"
                                "BSpline"
--ants_convergence              [MxNxO,<convergenceThreshold=1e-6>,<convergenceWindowSize=10>]
                                Convergence is determined from the number of iterations per level
                                and is determined by fitting a line to the normalized energy 
                                profile of the last N iterations (where N is specified by the window
                                size) and determining the slope which is then compared with the convergence threshold.
--ants_shrink                   [MxNxO] Specify the shrink factor for the virtual domain (typically 
                                the fixed image) at each level.
--ants_smoothing                [MxNxO] Specify the sigma of gaussian smoothing at each level.
                                Units are given in terms of voxels ('vox') or physical spacing ('mm'). 
                                Example usage is '4x2x1mm' and '4x2x1vox' where no units implies voxel spacing. 
--use_bet                       Use FSL's BET for skull stripping.
--bet_recursive                 [true/false] This option runs more "robust" brain center estimation.
--bet_threshold                 [0-1] Fractional intensity threshold (0->1); default=0.45; 
                                smaller values give larger brain outline estimates


NOTES

- BIDS:

    b1afiflow_BIDS.nf           To process BIDSified b1afi data. Note that BIDS for 
                                quantitative MRI data is under development as of 
                                early 2020. You can visit the GitHub project page
                                [here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bep001). 
- Example datasets: 

    Custom-organized data       TBA
    BIDSified b1afi data        https://osf.io/csjgx/                                

- Files should be compressed Nifti files (.nii.gz)

- Timing parameters in the .json files MUST be in seconds. 

- Subject IDs are used as the primary process ID and tag throughout the pipeline. 

- We adhere to a strict one-process one-container mapping, where possible using off-the shelf
  qMRLab containers. 

- All the OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS can be modified in the `nextflow.config` file. The same 
  config file is consumed by both `b1afiflow.nf` and `b1afiflow_BIDS.nf`.  

- Unless the docker option is enabled in the `nextflow.config`, the following
  dependencies must be installed and added to the system path: 
    * ANTs registration (https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs)
    * FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/)
    * Octave/MATLAB (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
                    (https://www.mathworks.com/)    
    * qMRLab > v2.3.1       (https://qmrlab.org)
    * git

If you have Docker installed, enabling docker option will make use of the 
following Docker images to execute processes: 
    - qmrlab/minimal (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/qmrlab/minimal)
                      594MB extends to 1.5GB
                      Built at each qMRLab release.   
    - qmrlab/antsfsl (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/qmrlab/antsfsl)
                      374MB extends to 1.2GB                      
                      Dockerfile is available at qMRLab/qMRflow.

- You can take advantage of Nextflow's comprehensive tracing and visualization 
  features while executing this pipeline: https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html.

  an issue at qMRflow's GitHub repo at https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRflow.
